List of things to do/planned to add
list is in no particular order

* Additions
** Pattern Multitool
 - From NAE2
 - Edits patterns in bulk
   - Ingredient/Output swapping
     - Maybe include amounts in this? or multiplcation on swapped stuff
     - ie replace Rubber with Silicone Rubber and half the needed amount since
       its twice as efficent
   - Multiplying the whole pattern amounts
     - if you Upgrade your setup so you need every pattern to move stacks at a
       time instead of just 1
       - Maybe get AE2 to natively push as much as possible (would cost
         performance tho)
   - Click on interface to open up its patterns for editing
   - Put patterns in tool for editing
   - Maybe for substituting allow the whole network to be edited?
     - How often would you not want to use your new ingredient everywhere?

* Optimizations
** Pattern P2P caching
 - Currently it rebuilds the whole list of outputs which time its queryed
 - Useful for if it changes, not useful when it's inside a tick and impossible
   to change
   - Or at least, I don't really care if someone does something so technical its
     editing the p2p outputs inside of the craft being outputted
