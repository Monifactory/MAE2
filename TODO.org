List of things to do/planned to add
Also works as a features list
list is in no particular order

* Additions [16%]
** DONE Pattern P2P Tunnel [2/3]
*** DONE Effectively copies pattern providers from the input(s) to the outputs
 - Works by letting pattern provider tunnel from the input to every output and
   seeing those as potential targets
*** DONE Alllows stuff to be input from the output, to tunnel back to the pattern provider on the input
*** TODO Keep track of which output goes to which input to allow sharing setups between ME systems
** TODO Pattern Multitool
 - Already exists in ExtendedAE, might PR an improved version that works with GT
   patterns tho
 - From NAE2
 - Edits patterns in bulk
   - Ingredient/Output swapping
     - Maybe include amounts in this? or multiplcation on swapped stuff
     - ie replace Rubber with Silicone Rubber and half the needed amount since
       its twice as efficent
   - Multiplying the whole pattern amounts
     - if you Upgrade your setup so you need every pattern to move stacks at a
       time instead of just 1
       - Maybe get AE2 to natively push as much as possible (would cost
         performance tho)
   - Click on interface to open up its patterns for editing
   - Put patterns in tool for editing
   - Maybe for substituting allow the whole network to be edited?
     - How often would you not want to use your new ingredient everywhere?

** TODO GregTech Patterns
 - Processing patterns that can also set circuit numbers in GT machines
 - Being a seperate pattern makes it nicer internally, and would allow the
   circuit number to be included in blocking mode
   - ie allow patterns to be sent multiple times, but only if the circuit
     numbers match, so the circuits don't interfere

** TODO Sticky Card
 - Card that goes in storage things
   - Storage bus
   - Storage cells
 - Makes it so that items that can enter the sticky storage will only ever enter the
   sticky storage, even if there's free space elsewhere

** TODO Beam Former [0/2]
*** TODO Allows a connenction to be formed through transparent blocks via a laser beam
*** TODO Beam has bloom to look cooler
 - Not much use aside from looking cool
   - Would make nicer looking cabling inside transparent blocks, since they'd be
     no need for facades on the laser traveling through transparent blocks

** TODO Interface Capacity Card
 - Kinda crazy that is capped to 4 buckets of fluid
 - Either increase the native amount or just allow capacity cards to multiply it



** TODO Guide Book Entries [0/6]
 - [ ] Pattern P2P Tunnel
 - [ ] Dense CPU Components
 - [ ] Pattern Multitool
 - [ ] GregTech Patterns
 - [ ] Sitcky Card
 - [ ] Beam Former
 - [ ] Interface Capacity Card
   - Can guide entries be added too?


* Optimizations
** Pattern P2P caching
 - Currently it rebuilds the whole list of outputs which time its queryed
   - Useful for if it changes, not useful when it's inside a tick and impossible
     to change
     - Or at least, I don't really care if someone does something so technical its
       editing the p2p outputs inside of the craft being outputted
