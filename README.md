# Modern AE2 Additions
A mod all about random additions. Mainly going to be whatever I feel like adding to the game to help with AE2.

As a note, this mod is most likely going to be using mixins kinda heavily which
might make it incompatible with other mods trying to do the same
thing. Sometimes the mixins just have to be done in a way that's incompatible.

Pull requests are welcome, either for new features or bug fixes, as long as new
features are relatively tame and within vanilla AE2's scope. Maybe for bug fixes
make an issue first to link with the PR and make sure its really a bug.

Along with code additions, if some artist wants to work for free and make assets
for MAE2, I'd welcome them. Even if you just think the colors of something is
wrong, I'd take it. I'm terrible with graphics.

# Credits
Some code used in this repository is copied/edited from the original
Applied Energistics 2. Should only be code in `@Overwrite` mixins or classes inside
the `appeng` package.

* Textures and Models Currently every texture/model in here is just a color
shifted version of AE2's texture. Full credits to the original artists, not gonna
take credit for hue shifting a crafting cpu
