# Modern AE2 Additions
A mod all about random additions. Mainly going to be whatever I feel like adding to the game to help with AE2.

As a note, this mod is most likely going to be using mixins kinda heavily which
might make it incompatible with other mods trying to do the same
thing. Sometimes the mixins just have to be done in a way that's incompatible.

Some code used in this repository is copied/edited from the original
Applied Energistics 2. Should only be code in `@Overwrite` mixins or classes inside
the `appeng` package.
