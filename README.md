# Modern AE2 Additions
A mod all about random additions. Mainly going to be whatever I feel like adding to the game to help with AE2.

As a note, this mod is most likely going to be using mixins kinda heavily which
might make it incompatible with other mods trying to do the same
thing. Sometimes the mixins just have to be done in a way that's incompatible.

Pull requests are welcome, either for new features or bug fixes, as long as new
features are relatively tame and within vanilla AE2's scope. Maybe for bug fixes
make an issue first to link with the PR and make sure its really a bug. If you
want ideas peruse the TODO list at TODO.org, its got new feature ideas, and
optimizations to implement

# Discord
Speaking of pull requests, I've taken up residence in Pansmith's Kitchen. It's a
discord server mainly for Monifactory development, but since MAE2 is practically
made for MAE2, I've got a channel there. Come in and talk about the mod or yell
at me to do stuff. (really do complain at me to get stuff done, I mainly work on
what people want, so if no one says anything I'll never prioritize it). Discord
link is here -> https://discord.gg/CEuSDXVsPc

Along with code additions, if some artist wants to work for free and make assets
for MAE2, I'd welcome them. Even if you just think the colors of something is
wrong, I'd take it. I'm terrible with graphics.
